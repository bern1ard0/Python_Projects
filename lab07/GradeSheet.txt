GRADE SHEET FOR CS134 LAB 7 ("Recursion!"):

    Warm-up Task: sumDigits
          * passes all doctests
          * has an explicit base case and correctly handles it 
          * correctly handles recursive call
          * the implementation is fully recursive; no loops are found
          * int not converted to str
          * clean and interpretable code with comments
    Task 1: bedtime
          * passes all doctests
          * correct calls to firstSentence and lastSentence
          * has an explicit base case 
          * the implementation is fully recursive; no loops are found
          * clean and interpretable code with comments
          * one additional doctest is provided
    Task 2: squares
          * drawSquares-400-20.ps found and looks good
          * drawNestedSquares(400, 20, PURPLE, WHITE) actually generates figure
          * drawNestedSquares calls drawSquare once
          * drawNestedSquares uses only the allowed turtle commands
          * drawNestedSquares uses color1, color2 rather than GOLD, PURPLE
          * the implementation is fully recursive; no loops
          * clean and interpretable code with comments
    Task 3: quilt
          * drawQuilt-500-4.ps found and looks good
          * drawQuilt(500, 4, PURPLE, GOLD) actually generates figure
          * drawQuilt calls drawSquare once
          * drawQuilt uses only the allowed turtle commands
          * drawQuilt uses color1, color2 rather than GOLD, PURPLE
          * the implementation is fully recursive; no loops are found
          * clean and interpretable code with comments
    Task 4: shrub
          * shrub-100-15-0.8-10.ps found and looks good
          * drawShrub(100, 15, 0.8, 10) actually generates figure
          * drawShrub(100, 15, 0.8, 10) prints (232, 3973.9861913600025)
          * shrub uses only the allowed turtle commands
          * the implementation is fully recursive; no loops are found
          * clean and interpretable code with comments
    Extra credit: fancy
          * produces correct output (figure and text)
          * drawFancySquares uses only the allowed turtle commands
          * the implementation is fully recursive; no loops are found
          * clean and interpretable code with comments
