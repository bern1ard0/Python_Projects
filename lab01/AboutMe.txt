I am Bernard Wongibe, an International student from Cameroon. I enjoy playing and watching football(soccer) and I'm a die-hard FC Barcelona fan. Fun fact: The African Cup of Nations that just ended last Sunday was hosted by Cameroon.  I'm also passionate about teaching others.  In my hometown, Bafoussam, you can get food at a famous restaurant, LE BAHO. Delicious traditional Cameroonian meals. But, the tradition is that, if you have a guest, you cook for him, so, you'd likely eat at my place.
